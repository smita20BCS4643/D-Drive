# D-Drive
Decentralized Storage Space using Blockchain and IPFS Protocol

## INTRODUCTION 
### Problem Statement 

Centralized cloud-based storage has received great attention and has been extensively used by many companies indecent years. However, these cloud-based storage are not secure because of the involvement of a centralized entity or a third party. 
Hence, in order to maximize data privacy and security, there is a need for blockchain-based decentralized system.

### Proposed Solution

- This proposed D-drive, an IPFS-based decentralized storage space to solve the problem.
Decentralized storage using blockchain and IPFS will allow us to upload file in a decentralized way, allowing us to share in a trust less censorship resistant fashion.
- D-Drive is a software solution trying to prove that centralized cloud-based storage applications Can be decentralized, more secure, and efficient. 
- We proposed developing a web-based application that provides a user interface, from which the user can directly share their data or files.
- Then, the user file is encrypted and stored across a peer-to-peer network using IPFS protocol instead of HTTP protocol and a cryptocurrency will be used as a payment -mechanism. 
- D-Drive’s primary objective is to provide secure decentralized storage space.

## Technologies Used
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Truffle: Framework for creating Ethereum smart contracts.(solidity programming language)

- Ganache: It is the blockchain that will run on our computer to run transactions and deploy smart contracts without having to pay real money.

- Metamask: Browser extension to connect the browser to the blockchain. It is Ethereum wallet to turn our browser to Blockchain browser.

- Web3.js: Collection of libraries that allows you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, and WebSocket (connects our application to the blockchain)
 
- ReactJS: JavaScript library used for frontend.

- Solidity: Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts

- IPFS: The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
